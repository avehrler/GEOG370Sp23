<h1>What parks are within walking distance of the Haw River in Chatham County?</h1>
<body>
    <h2>I decided to focus on parks near the Haw River since I enjoy canoeing in it and I support accessible recreational activities
        for the river. The data here is just for the park boundaries around Chatham County. I first defined walking distance as 
        .25 miles, and made the buffer around the river equivalent to that distance. Then, I used the intersect tool with a park 
        boundaries shapefile to see which parks were within that distance. I also clipped the shapefile of the waterbodies to only 
        include the Haw River since the other waterbodies made a more distracting image</h2>.
